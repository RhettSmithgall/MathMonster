Math Monster is a scientific calculator made using ANTLR, a compiler. 

unlike traditional simple calculators that perform operations in the order they are written and are limited in the operations they can perform, math monster uses the principles of compilers to correctly perform the order of operations to any given expression. Additional, math monster can make use of far more complex functions than a tradtional calculator including different bases of log and square root as well as all the trigenometry functions and their inverse.
